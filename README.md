## Description

This plugin designed with extensibility in mind for data that should be associated with a particular block type but need not have any defined meaning. `data-*` attributes will allow you to store extra information on different Gutenberg blocks, without other hacks such as non-standard attributes, appending properties on DOM, or modifying a block as HTML which will throw a block validation error when opening the post edit page once again.
